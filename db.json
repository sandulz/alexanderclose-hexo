The concept is nothing new, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming\" target=\"_blank\">D. Edwards Deming</a> preached that the customer is the most important part of the product line&rdquo; as early as the 50&prime;s, but the nearly frictionless technology of the internet and the implications of networks is creating a funding process that is entirely new. While that particular service is only in it's infancy, barely two years old, it's starting to pickup speed quickly and it's gonna be big. They hit their first two projects receiving over a milling dollars in funding a couple of weeks ago, both on the same day. It's a perfect example of how where there were once gatekeepers choosing what music, movies, or a number of other projects/products were produced, the pyramid shaped hierarchy has flipped onto it's head and now an individual can connect directly with any number of people/fans/customers, skipping middle management entirely. It's a system with no gatekeeper, much less friction, and is a close resemblance of a meritocracy. It's for the better.\n\nThere are a few key implications of networks that have already risen. The first and most obvious is the growth of social networks. For business, it has created a whole new meaning to customer feedback. Once upon a time you could only track or transfer positive/negative feedback through direct customer interaction. That world is no longer. With customers sharing their day-to-day lives and experiences with all of the their friends (or anyone that will listen) a bad review spreads fast. For business doing great things, the ones that really care about their customers, it also brings entirely new opportunity. If you are remarkable, truly noteworthy, the good news will spread fast and far. <a href=\"http://garyvaynerchuk.com/?166c9b90\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> preaches this fact. He's quick to argue that generations before us (even just our grandparents) were better suited to do business in this super-connected world. Going out of your way to please your customers, like the invention of the bakers dozen&rdquo;, can propel you to new heights with the aid of twitter. <a href=\"http://www.zappos.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zappos</a> would be the poster child of customer service. Case in point, there was a woman in Texas who was ripping off Zappo's generous return policy by buy a pair of shoes, wearing them out on a Saturday night, and returning them come Monday morning. While this was extreme example of a customer taking advantage of a company's policy, Zappo's let is slide. Turns out the woman was telling everyone she knew about the extraordinary return policy, and created far more free advertising and business than her shady returns took away. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Hsieh</a> gets it; we're a service company that just happens to sell shoes.&rdquo;\n\nCollaborative consumption is also a really interesting implication of networks. While it's been overrun by the Groupon goliath, the space should follow the natural curve of any disruption innovation. First a hung boom, then a huge bust, followed by a more gentle growth curve with sustainable products. Collaborative consumption also includes shared utilities such a ZipCar or Car2Go, as well as more underground movements like recent cash mobs&rdquo;.<a href=\"http://www.thesocialfeed.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Social Feed</a> would also fit into this category. It's the collaborative consumption of a product/service at a restaurant, with the aid of organization though SaaS. As the networks become more and more connected, consumption networks in general should get stronger and more accepted by the masses. It's also a psychological shift. While past generations have marked success by your ability to acquire stuff, the current generation is trending more towards other things, a letting mass consumption slide slightly. When psychological changes pair with technological ones, it's a good indication that big changes are in the works.","source":"_posts/Centralized-Hierarchies-to-Decentralized-Networks.md","raw":"title: Centralized Hierarchies to Decentralized Networks\ndate: 2012-02-20 19:21:05\ntags:\n---\nAs a society, we are undergoing one of the most significant macro-level shifts in our lifetimes; the shift from centralized hierarchies to decentralized networks.<!-- more --> We're just starting to see how this affects governments, cultures, industries, and individuals.

The first and most obvious is the growth of social networks. For business, it has created a whole new meaning to customer feedback. Once upon a time you could only track or transfer positive/negative feedback through direct customer interaction. That world is no longer. With customers sharing their day-to-day lives and experiences with all of the their friends (or anyone that will listen) a bad review spreads fast. For business doing great things, the ones that really care about their customers, it also brings entirely new opportunity. If you are remarkable, truly noteworthy, the good news will spread fast and far. <a href=\"http://garyvaynerchuk.com/?166c9b90\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> preaches this fact. He's quick to argue that generations before us (even just our grandparents) were better suited to do business in this super-connected world. Going out of your way to please your customers, like the invention of the bakers dozen&rdquo;, can propel you to new heights with the aid of twitter. <a href=\"http://www.zappos.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zappos</a> would be the poster child of customer service. Case in point, there was a woman in Texas who was ripping off Zappo's generous return policy by buy a pair of shoes, wearing them out on a Saturday night, and returning them come Monday morning. While this was extreme example of a customer taking advantage of a company's policy, Zappo's let is slide. Turns out the woman was telling everyone she knew about the extraordinary return policy, and created far more free advertising and business than her shady returns took away. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Hsieh</a> gets it; we're a service company that just happens to sell shoes.&rdquo;\n\nCollaborative consumption is also a really interesting implication of networks. While it's been overrun by the Groupon goliath, the space should follow the natural curve of any disruption innovation. First a hung boom, then a huge bust, followed by a more gentle growth curve with sustainable products. Collaborative consumption also includes shared utilities such a ZipCar or Car2Go, as well as more underground movements like recent cash mobs&rdquo;.<a href=\"http://www.thesocialfeed.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Social Feed</a> would also fit into this category. It's the collaborative consumption of a product/service at a restaurant, with the aid of organization though SaaS. As the networks become more and more connected, consumption networks in general should get stronger and more accepted by the masses. It's also a psychological shift. While past generations have marked success by your ability to acquire stuff, the current generation is trending more towards other things, a letting mass consumption slide slightly. When psychological changes pair with technological ones, it's a good indication that big changes are in the works.","slug":"Centralized-Hierarchies-to-Decentralized-Networks","published":1,"updated":"2015-11-22T22:28:40.000Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cimte9k3600003jkr4th9hxd0"},{"title":"Two Media Dots","date":"2012-02-11T03:16:54.000Z","_content":"In relation to a Ted Talk and Blog Post.<!-- more -->\nThe first chunk of media is a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_van_uhm_why_i_chose_a_gun.html\" target=\"_blank\">TED talk by Peter Van Uhm</a>, Netherlands chief of defence.

To be great investment banker, you once had to plead with a broker to allow him to let you shadow him. You used to have to fetch coffee's and stand in the corner to get a glimpse into the life of a professional and mentorship and guidance. It's not the same anymore. As highly regarded professionals share more and more of their lives and stories, if you look, you can find incredible amounts of information. Want to develop the marketing prowess of Seth Godin? You can read his daily blog, view his reading list for the past year, aggregate all his Disqus comments in the click of a button and gain a never before incite into his professional work. You can see where he gets his information, and what blogs he reads. The best part, it's not limited to geography or social status. If you can afford access to the internet, or a daily coffee habit, you find more information than you can intake.\n\nTaken to the next level, not only can you read other peoples daily thoughts, you can now participate in the discussion from anywhere in the world. <a href=\"http://LINK\" target=\"_blank\">Avc.com</a> is the best example of an interactive and engaged blog community that I know of, but it's clear there are many more. If you're interested in the tech-startup world or the VC community, the resources that community provides is unmatched. Fred Wilson does a good job writing about interesting and relevant tech news, even if it's mostly skewed to the investments of USV and there is a clear personal motivation. Not all days of the week are self centred, however, and he goes far has hosting a 'MBA Monday&rdquo; series featuring concepts and guest posts by prominent CEO's and founders. But the real magic is in the discussions and comments by the community of readers. Often including very accomplished people, (Seth Godin, Dennis Crowly, Eric Wahlforss, Brad Feld, Chris Dixon, Mark Suster, to name a few) comments often in the hundreds flow every day. Following the idea of collaborative consumption, these communities offer a form of collaborative learning. Often the bulletin board is littered with fake identities or aliases, and the discussions (or arguments) that develop are better than most real world classroom I've been in. Most online forums tend to have their share of conflict. Something about sitting behind a computer, often with an alias as your bouncer, lets people rip their true thoughts. While some comment systems (*cough* techcrunch *cough*) attract their fair share of trolls or flamewars, there are plenty with the contrary. There is a fine line between cranky and contrarian sometimes. It's this tension that develops between users that lead to the spark, the creation of new outlooks, new levels of comprehension and the formation of new ideas. Discussions that reveal themselves as heated debates have better outcomes.\n\nIt's also what you do with it, how you push and measure your own development. Blogging isn't the narcissistic act it was once viewed as. <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Dixon</a> sums it up well, 'I also blog a lot, and I think of it this way: I have information that comes in, and then I meet with interesting people. I measure whether or not I've had an interesting day or week by my blogging productivity. So it's a three stage machine, right. Input raw material and information; meet with interesting people, and then learn and process that information in a post. It's a metric to see whether or not I'm doing a good job.'","source":"_posts/Education-Reform.md","raw":"title: Education Reform\ndate: 2012-02-23 19:39:55\ntags:\n---\nOne of the most challenging and rewarding thought experiments is imagining life (thoughts, emotions, etc.) within the context of being someone else.<!-- more --> While usually a tool reserved for conflict resolution, negotiations or even celebrity fantasy, this concept has taken a new meaning with the exploration of the ipad app, news.me.

As highly regarded professionals share more and more of their lives and stories, if you look, you can find incredible amounts of information. Want to develop the marketing prowess of Seth Godin? You can read his daily blog, view his reading list for the past year, aggregate all his Disqus comments in the click of a button and gain a never before incite into his professional work. You can see where he gets his information, and what blogs he reads. The best part, it's not limited to geography or social status. If you can afford access to the internet, or a daily coffee habit, you find more information than you can intake.\n\nTaken to the next level, not only can you read other peoples daily thoughts, you can now participate in the discussion from anywhere in the world. <a href=\"http://LINK\" target=\"_blank\">Avc.com</a> is the best example of an interactive and engaged blog community that I know of, but it's clear there are many more. If you're interested in the tech-startup world or the VC community, the resources that community provides is unmatched. Fred Wilson does a good job writing about interesting and relevant tech news, even if it's mostly skewed to the investments of USV and there is a clear personal motivation. Not all days of the week are self centred, however, and he goes far has hosting a 'MBA Monday&rdquo; series featuring concepts and guest posts by prominent CEO's and founders. But the real magic is in the discussions and comments by the community of readers. Often including very accomplished people, (Seth Godin, Dennis Crowly, Eric Wahlforss, Brad Feld, Chris Dixon, Mark Suster, to name a few) comments often in the hundreds flow every day. Following the idea of collaborative consumption, these communities offer a form of collaborative learning. Often the bulletin board is littered with fake identities or aliases, and the discussions (or arguments) that develop are better than most real world classroom I've been in. Most online forums tend to have their share of conflict. Something about sitting behind a computer, often with an alias as your bouncer, lets people rip their true thoughts. While some comment systems (*cough* techcrunch *cough*) attract their fair share of trolls or flamewars, there are plenty with the contrary. There is a fine line between cranky and contrarian sometimes. It's this tension that develops between users that lead to the spark, the creation of new outlooks, new levels of comprehension and the formation of new ideas. Discussions that reveal themselves as heated debates have better outcomes.\n\nIt's also what you do with it, how you push and measure your own development. Blogging isn't the narcissistic act it was once viewed as. <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Dixon</a> sums it up well, 'I also blog a lot, and I think of it this way: I have information that comes in, and then I meet with interesting people. I measure whether or not I've had an interesting day or week by my blogging productivity. So it's a three stage machine, right. Input raw material and information; meet with interesting people, and then learn and process that information in a post. It's a metric to see whether or not I'm doing a good job.'","slug":"Education-Reform","published":1,"updated":"2015-11-22T22:28:40.000Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cimte9k6p00043jkrpvo8awdf"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
