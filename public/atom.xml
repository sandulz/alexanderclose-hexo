    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Engineers rule the world. While business professionals, lawyers, and doctors all scale the ranks of a cultural hierarchy, they’re all subservient to the control of an engineer. Why? Because the very ladder they are all climbing was designed and built by an engineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the word “engineer” brings visions of computer scientists and bridge builders to the minds of most, the truth is that engineers are found in all shapes and sizes throughout a variety of professions. They are a professional practitioner concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical problems. The word is derived from the Latin roots &lt;em&gt;ingeniare&lt;/em&gt; “to contrive, devise” and &lt;em&gt;ingenium&lt;/em&gt; “cleverness”. Truth is, it’s anyone who identifies a problem and uses their skills and ingenuity to build the solution. Boiled down, it sounds vaguely familiar to a certain buzzword these days. “Entrepreneur”. Todays adoption of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lean startup&lt;/a&gt; methodology is bringing the two professions even closer. The smartest run startups of the current day operate like the pursuit of scientific knowledge through the scientific method - complete with experiments, control groups and theory tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrial system (the one currently breaking) that created vast periods of productivity and wealth creation throughout the late 1800&amp;rsquo;s and 1900&amp;rsquo;s was purposely designed and built. It didn&amp;rsquo;t come to be through creationism, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t assembled through dumb luck. The current network of large corporations and firms was first designed and popularized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frederick Taylor&lt;/a&gt; (a mechanical engineers for the record) in the late 1880’s. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Scientific_Management#Summary_of_the_monograph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Principles of Scientific Management&lt;/a&gt;, a monograph from 1911, was the bible to building large scale companies using people as inter-replaceable pieces of the efficiency puzzle. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose was to use empirical methods to decide what matters, push forward the theme of economic efficiency in the industrial age and build organizations that maximize shareholder value. The system, designed by the Taylor and build by all the founders and middle managers that followed, was the best stab at a problem to get widgets built and make those higher on the food chain fat. It worked as best it could for a long period of time, but as with anything, technology has progressed to the point of making that before it obsolete. Modern day tech has finally surged past our techniques and its time for engineers to use new tech, skills and methods to build an entirely new, optimized operating system. While it may cost a few bucks, and we will all undoubtably have to learn how to use this new system, it&amp;rsquo;s about time to trade in for the new thing. At the very core of a commerce -from the coffee shop, to wall street, to the entire market as a whole- is a driving force to reduce inefficiencies and provide greater value. In turn, the organization recaptures the value produced as profits in return. Organizations were built because they were the best way known at the time to reduce inefficiencies and create the most profit. Find an musician you think is talented, organize a team to support them, spend a huge chunk of money on advertising and distributing the cd of the musician, buy the audience attention, and make a boat load of money on record sales. Use that money to find the next musician and repeat. It made logical sense, but does it anymore? As the internet provides increased connectivity through the shift from centralized hierarchies to de-centralized networks, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost much to connect with others. Find fans or connect with customers, apart from a broadband provider, it&amp;rsquo;s basically free. When it was once beneficial to form firms and organizations to reduce and consolidate the transaction costs between parties, it will soon become easier to preform a variety of work without the aid of a large firm. Why be a small cog in a large company machine if you can be an entire machine yourself, spending none of the traditional transaction costs, and have 100% profits going to you. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like your boss, why even have one? All it will take is the formation of networks to allow the right parties to connect. Etsy. WorkMarket. Shapeways. The engineers are already on it. The system is changing fast. People are becoming their own brands, companies and industries are fragmenting, and there is a rapid emergence of online networks in every fashion imaginable. The frictionless exchange of information is eliminating the non-value adding costs of firms (middle management, transaction costs, etc). Some of the large companies are going to have trouble maintaining their structure and status in the coming years. Once the inefficiencies are exposed, engineers will design the better way. In his 1937 essay, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Nature of the Firm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ronald Coase&lt;/a&gt; extrapolates this to a larger extent. And about people changing their ways, after technology brings the next wave of innovation and makes it easier and cheaper to use a different system, our culture will follow. Coase&amp;rsquo;s theories can be pushed even further. Although it may seem crazy, they can apply to nation-states too. In our hyper-connected globalized world, why do we form nation-states or political groups at all? If we don&amp;rsquo;t need middle men to represent us internationally or to lobby laws when an entire nation can connect instantly, why is there any government at all? In a way the purpose of government in similar to that of corporations - reduce the transaction costs so that we can establish commerce with a wide group of people. As information technology sweeps through music, media, and health care, government is just another domino destined to fall. And once again, it won&amp;rsquo;t be politicians building it, it won&amp;rsquo;t be lawyers or lobbyists making the changes, and it won&amp;rsquo;t company management barking any orders. Engineers will build it, and they will come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging and rewarding thought experiments is imagining life (thoughts, emotions, etc.) within the context of being someone else.&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While usually a tool reserved for conflict resolution, negotiations or even celebrity fantasy, this concept has taken a new meaning with the exploration of the ipad app, news.me. With the help of a little technological know-how, you can now swap your news feed for someone else’s. Dubbed ‘cross-dressing’ in other technological circles, it allows you to observe and absorb the exact settings that an other person has. With the features and possibilities of content curation these days, a news feed has become a very personalized setting. The obvious example, a twitter stream. Imagine the educational perspective of being able to view all the information that the President of the United states sees in a day. While that may be a little overzealous with the amount of classified documents, the idea is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to follow someones life, mimic their activities and absorb the information that they absorb gives unlimited educational potential. To be great investment banker, you once had to plead with a broker to allow him to let you shadow him. You used to have to fetch coffee’s and stand in the corner to get a glimpse into the life of a professional and mentorship and guidance. It’s not the same anymore. As highly regarded professionals share more and more of their lives and stories, if you look, you can find incredible amounts of information. Want to develop the marketing prowess of Seth Godin? You can read his daily blog, view his reading list for the past year, aggregate all his Disqus comments in the click of a button and gain a never before incite into his professional work. You can see where he gets his information, and what blogs he reads. The best part, it’s not limited to geography or social status. If you can afford access to the internet, or a daily coffee habit, you find more information than you can intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken to the next level, not only can you read other peoples daily thoughts, you can now participate in the discussion from anywhere in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://LINK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Avc.com&lt;/a&gt; is the best example of an interactive and engaged blog community that I know of, but it’s clear there are many more. If you’re interested in the tech-startup world or the VC community, the resources that community provides is unmatched. Fred Wilson does a good job writing about interesting and relevant tech news, even if it’s mostly skewed to the investments of USV and there is a clear personal motivation. Not all days of the week are self centred, however, and he goes far has hosting a ‘MBA Monday&amp;rdquo; series featuring concepts and guest posts by prominent CEO’s and founders. But the real magic is in the discussions and comments by the community of readers. Often including very accomplished people, (Seth Godin, Dennis Crowly, Eric Wahlforss, Brad Feld, Chris Dixon, Mark Suster, to name a few) comments often in the hundreds flow every day. Following the idea of collaborative consumption, these communities offer a form of collaborative learning. Often the bulletin board is littered with fake identities or aliases, and the discussions (or arguments) that develop are better than most real world classroom I’ve been in. Most online forums tend to have their share of conflict. Something about sitting behind a computer, often with an alias as your bouncer, lets people rip their true thoughts. While some comment systems (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; techcrunch &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;) attract their fair share of trolls or flamewars, there are plenty with the contrary. There is a fine line between cranky and contrarian sometimes. It’s this tension that develops between users that lead to the spark, the creation of new outlooks, new levels of comprehension and the formation of new ideas. Discussions that reveal themselves as heated debates have better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also what you do with it, how you push and measure your own development. Blogging isn’t the narcissistic act it was once viewed as. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdixon.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Dixon&lt;/a&gt; sums it up well, ‘I also blog a lot, and I think of it this way: I have information that comes in, and then I meet with interesting people. I measure whether or not I’ve had an interesting day or week by my blogging productivity. So it’s a three stage machine, right. Input raw material and information; meet with interesting people, and then learn and process that information in a post. It’s a metric to see whether or not I’m doing a good job.’&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Centralized Hierarchies to Decentralized Networks</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a society, we are undergoing one of the most significant macro-level shifts in our lifetimes; the shift from centralized hierarchies to decentralized networks.&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We’re just starting to see how this affects governments, cultures, industries, and individuals. Whether you are building a tech startup or whether you are opening a coffee shop, it’s imperative that you understand not just the Internet, but the mechanics and implications of networks. They will inform just about anything you create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://garychou.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gary Chou&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christinacacioppo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christina Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://usv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Union Square Ventures&lt;/a&gt; |&lt;a href=&quot;http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/classes/spring12/entrepreneurial-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurial Design at SVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signal was Napster. Like an indicator wave forecasting a set of waves approaching, in June of 1999, Napster was one of the initial creative destructions forecasting the monumental change about to occur. The music industry was quickly broken and for the most part, still is. While the web has been around for only slightly over a decade, the rest of the world and the industries it contains are quickly shifting to an entirely new way of being. Music, and the entertainment industry at large was the first to get hit, and quickly the rest will follow suit.&lt;br&gt;If your vice in life is to try and accelerate these changes within industries and propel the economy and society towards the next level, the question is what’s next? What companies can be built to capitalize on the shift? Simply speaking, the idea would be to build a network of engaged users that bypasses an industry that was once built on a hierarchy and supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; is an indication of an entirely new way of producing projects, like the old smoke signal&amp;rdquo; marketing technique, you can now test your idea, find your market, and fund production from the best possible source &amp;ndash; customers. The concept is nothing new, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;D. Edwards Deming&lt;/a&gt; preached that the customer is the most important part of the product line&amp;rdquo; as early as the 50&amp;prime;s, but the nearly frictionless technology of the internet and the implications of networks is creating a funding process that is entirely new. While that particular service is only in it’s infancy, barely two years old, it’s starting to pickup speed quickly and it’s gonna be big. They hit their first two projects receiving over a milling dollars in funding a couple of weeks ago, both on the same day. It’s a perfect example of how where there were once gatekeepers choosing what music, movies, or a number of other projects/products were produced, the pyramid shaped hierarchy has flipped onto it’s head and now an individual can connect directly with any number of people/fans/customers, skipping middle management entirely. It’s a system with no gatekeeper, much less friction, and is a close resemblance of a meritocracy. It’s for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few key implications of networks that have already risen. The first and most obvious is the growth of social networks. For business, it has created a whole new meaning to customer feedback. Once upon a time you could only track or transfer positive/negative feedback through direct customer interaction. That world is no longer. With customers sharing their day-to-day lives and experiences with all of the their friends (or anyone that will listen) a bad review spreads fast. For business doing great things, the ones that really care about their customers, it also brings entirely new opportunity. If you are remarkable, truly noteworthy, the good news will spread fast and far. &lt;a href=&quot;http://garyvaynerchuk.com/?166c9b90&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk&lt;/a&gt; preaches this fact. He’s quick to argue that generations before us (even just our grandparents) were better suited to do business in this super-connected world. Going out of your way to please your customers, like the invention of the bakers dozen&amp;rdquo;, can propel you to new heights with the aid of twitter. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zappos.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zappos&lt;/a&gt; would be the poster child of customer service. Case in point, there was a woman in Texas who was ripping off Zappo’s generous return policy by buy a pair of shoes, wearing them out on a Saturday night, and returning them come Monday morning. While this was extreme example of a customer taking advantage of a company’s policy, Zappo’s let is slide. Turns out the woman was telling everyone she knew about the extraordinary return policy, and created far more free advertising and business than her shady returns took away. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Hsieh&lt;/a&gt; gets it; we’re a service company that just happens to sell shoes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative consumption is also a really interesting implication of networks. While it’s been overrun by the Groupon goliath, the space should follow the natural curve of any disruption innovation. First a hung boom, then a huge bust, followed by a more gentle growth curve with sustainable products. Collaborative consumption also includes shared utilities such a ZipCar or Car2Go, as well as more underground movements like recent cash mobs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesocialfeed.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Social Feed&lt;/a&gt; would also fit into this category. It’s the collaborative consumption of a product/service at a restaurant, with the aid of organization though SaaS. As the networks become more and more connected, consumption networks in general should get stronger and more accepted by the masses. It’s also a psychological shift. While past generations have marked success by your ability to acquire stuff, the current generation is trending more towards other things, a letting mass consumption slide slightly. When psychological changes pair with technological ones, it’s a good indication that big changes are in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two Media Dots</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In relation to a Ted Talk and Blog Post.&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first chunk of media is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_van_uhm_why_i_chose_a_gun.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TED talk by Peter Van Uhm&lt;/a&gt;, Netherlands chief of defence. Uhm makes the argument that the tool he uses to make the world a safer place is, in fact, a gun. He address the TED audience, an collection of talented individuals who by contrast use a pen, or a paint brush, or a computer, or mico-loans, to make the world a better place. After which he tells a story of his father fighting the Nazi’s and how that led him to his work in the Amsterdam army. The story’s climax is when his father was unable to stop a Nazi crossing a river due to a faulty, old gun. This failure of weaponry leads to his conclusion that the possession of a gun and directed use of it, leads to the current state of the world. A world which in the last 500 years has seen a decline in violence, year after year. A comparably peaceful world. The creation of the constitutional state, which empowers an army with weapons and uses a democratic system to create values, morals and laws, enforces with stronger legitimized violence. He argues that is why our world sees less acted violence every day. Summed up, the enforcement of democratically decided penalties which outweigh the use of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other hunk of media is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/2012/02/01/facebook-goes-public-zuckerberg-in-public-parts-wwgd/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post by Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, over at buzzmachine.com. He’s written a book called Private Parts &amp;ndash; How Sharing in the Digital Age Improves the Way we Work and Live. His story involves his very public sharing of a battle with prostate cancer. Open sharing in which he states has led to a wave of positive change, from sharing stories with others battling cancer, to the support that flocked to him, to his friends and family going to get checked for early signs of cancer themselves. So much good came from his public openness, he states, that he now asks himself about things he keeps &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo;; is he being selfish? Publicness and sharing personal information, in the end, is about building relationships. Relationships are central to being human.&lt;br&gt;Jeff wrote a post on Feb 1st, 2012, that was relevant to the expected Facebook IPO announcement, it was about an interview with Mark Zuckerberg and his quest to make the world a more open and connected place. &amp;ldquo;We hear the inherent optimism that fuels the likes of him: that with the right tools and power in the right hands, the world will keep getting better.&amp;rdquo; Zuckerberg believes he is helping us share, which will make the world more public and lead to greater transparency and trust, accountability and integrity. While it started with FB, tools to help people share across a digital medium are exploding across the graph at near asymptotic rates. Records keep getting broken. First Twitter broke the growth record, now Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t &amp;lsquo;Are you completely private’, it’s &amp;ldquo;which things do you want to share and which things do you not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;When Facebook started, people were still worried about privacy, they wanted control of what was shared and what was not. After a few outcries of facts being shared without permission, people are starting to care less and less about what is shared. As &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; lists grow past 1000, it matters less what &amp;ldquo;only friends&amp;rdquo; can see versus the &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo;. If you’re surprised that a potential employer can Google your name, you’re living behind the times. As people become privy to the tools available and the potential benefits of sharing information about yourself, the majority may start to catch on. People don’t have lifelong careers with one company any more. If you can create a notable &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo; for yourself, the &amp;ldquo;John Smith Brand&amp;rdquo;, you win. The notion of wanting your information to be private, may turn into self promotion and wanting everyone look. This all gets summed up by Zucker law, a social version of Moore’s law. It decrees: this year, people will share twice as much information as they did last year, and the next, they will share twice as much again. Foursquare checkins, Pinterest taste graphs, Instagraph photo updates; while the services will undoubtably fragment, the depth and volume is growing at a crazy rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, or in a few years time, the question may in fact be, “what things don’t you share, and why not?”&lt;br&gt;To connect the two dots: If the constitutional use of a gun by an appointed state is a phycological cloud that hangs over everyone and keeps the majority from acts of violence, is the inevitable growth of sharing and the trajectory towards living a completely open digital life the new &amp;ldquo;gun&amp;rdquo; to keep people from straying to untrustworthy acts? If you’re keeping something secret, why? What are you hiding? Why not share everything, as the more you share, the more relationships you can foster and the more of a fulfilled life you can have. If you are about to do something untrustworthy, and realize that in such a connected world, you are destined to get noticed by your community of peers, would that stop you? Are we heading towards a society whereby not only laws, but moral integrity is policed by a community of connected peers?&lt;/p&gt;
